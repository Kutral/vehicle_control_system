# Vehicle Control System with Web Interface and Automated Testing

This project implements a **Vehicle Control System** with a web-based interface, allowing users to control a simulated vehicle's speed and steering angle. The system is built using Python and Flask, providing a simple and intuitive way to interact with the vehicle controls. Additionally, the project includes a robust testing framework using **Selenium** and **Pytest** to ensure the reliability and correctness of the system through automated browser interactions.

## Key Features
- **Web Interface**: Control the vehicle's speed and steering angle via a user-friendly web page.
- **Automated Testing**: Comprehensive tests using Selenium for browser automation and Pytest for test structuring and execution.
- **Flask Integration**: A lightweight web server to handle user inputs and display vehicle status.
- **Easy to Use and Extend**: The project is designed to be simple, making it ideal for learning and experimentation.

## Project Overview
The **Vehicle Control System** simulates basic vehicle operations such as acceleration, braking, and steering. Users can interact with these controls through a web interface, which updates in real-time to reflect the vehicle's current speed and steering angle.

The testing framework leverages **Selenium** to automate interactions with the web interface, simulating user actions like clicking buttons and entering values. **Pytest** is used to organize and run these tests, ensuring that the system behaves as expected under various conditions.

This project serves as an excellent example of how to integrate web development with automated testing, making it a valuable resource for developers and testers alike.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Flask**: Web framework for building the user interface.
- **Selenium**: Tool for automating browser interactions.
- **Pytest**: Framework for writing and running tests.
